the goal of this map<br><br>
   <blockquote>

    this map is dedicated to <a href="https://workmanarts.com"><font color="red">Workman Arts</font></a> (WA).
    <br><br><br>

    we understand WA as a non-profit art organisation which aims at manifesting the art of individuals who
    are labelled or identify as: invisibly disabled, neurodiverse, mentally ill, living with a DSM diagnosis,
    clients of mental health services or equivalent. we believe that most of Workman Arts&apos; artist members would
    not accept pathologization, but use any of these etiquettes as a reclaim or for access to the necessary
    services.
    <br><br><br>

    this map is activated by <a href="https://claudewittmann.ca/DDADH/ddadh.html"><font color="red">DDADH</font></a>,
    <i> the dispossessed disabled artists demanding housing</i>. most of DDADH members are artist members of WA. 
    <br><br><br>

    this map shares DDADH&apos;s research and advocacy and gathers your housing crises and housing utopias.
    <br><br><br>

    the goal of this map is to convince Workman Arts to have
    a <a href="https://claudewittmann.ca/DDADH/attachments%20DDADH/WORKERSTRATEGIST/DDADH_2pager_Housing_Sept172022.pdf">
    <font color="red">housing worker and long-term housing strategist</font></a> on staff.
    <br><br><br>

    DDADH has already worked for two years on this goal and has made some progress,
    but there has been a confusing semi-responsiveness on WA&apos;s side, which has reminded
    us of how the city of Toronto undermines research and proposals by the
    people at the core of systemic discrimination.
    <br><br><br>
        
    still we choose to believe that WA would agree that <font color="red">"art" in its institutional definition is
    undue privilege if the basics such as housing are not covered</font>.
    <br><br><br>
        
    Workman Arts: it is time to shift your priorities.
    <br><br><br>
    
    other organizations have made the shift and are taking responsibility in making sure that our human rights are respected.
    this is <font color="fuchsia">art</font> and it is urgent and it yours to do with us.
    <br><br><br>
    our human right to housing is enshrined in the Canada National Housing Strategy Act since 2019.
