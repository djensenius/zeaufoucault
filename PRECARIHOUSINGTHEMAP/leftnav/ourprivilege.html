    acknowledgment of our privilege<br><br>
    draft by claude wittmann,on July 8, 2021<br><br>

    <blockquote>


    <a>some of us artists have the privilege to be seen as white and/or "educated" and/or cismale
        and thus to automatically have better access to the basic right to housing.</a><br><br>

    <a>we acknowledge that most of the activators of this map are currently housed while we know that plenty others are going through grueling
        housing insecurity.</a><br><br>

    <a>we acknowledge that during our individual housing crises, we have had access to supports from friends, 
    (chosen) family and artist peers, from organisations such as Workman Arts and the Parkdale Neighbourhood
    Land Trust (PNLT), from legal clinics, and also, from city councillors and their crews and, even if
    through fraught city programs, from some city and agencies' housing workers.</a><br><br>

    <a>we acknowledge that we have not been a resident of an encampment and thus not experienced the City of
     Toronto's violent criminalizations and evictions.</a>
