why are we working with a map?<br>
in progress: this version composed by claude wittmann, July 8, 2021<br><br><br><br>

here is a list of questions which are on our minds:<br><br>

maps have been tools of colonization, so why do we work with a map?<br><br>

how do we participate in decolonization while using a map?<br><br>

map are about relationships between politico-socio-economic systems and the physical environment.
this map having to do with our housing insecurity and our ramping erasure in Toronto, what relationships do we want to make visible/erase/create/dismantle/dream/counter-make, etc.?
<br><br>
how can our map making process reflect the map we make? example: if our map has to do with erasure, how does "erasure" as a process supports our map making process? 
what do we erase in the process?<br><br>

what are the differences between counter-mapping, demapping, anti-mapping, etc?<br><br>

what are we doing really and who does it benefit and who could it harm?<br><br><br>





other maps we appreciate:<br><br>
