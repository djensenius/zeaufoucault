why are we working with a soundmap?<br>
draft answer by claude wittmann, November 2022<br><br><br>


<blockquote>

why a soundmap?<br><br>

<blockquote>
when i open a map of Toronto, i see a story but there is no "home".<br><br>
i am reminded of the anti-democratic powers that the province and Toronto's Mayer took over Toronto residents with 
<a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-43/session-1/bill-23">Bill-23</a> and 
<a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-43/session-1/bill-39">Bill-39</a> recently and of 
<a href="http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2023.CC2.1">Mayor Tory's 2023 Housing Plan</a>.<br><br>
i am blown away by the speed and violence at which the socialization of housing is negated and erased from vocabulary even.<br><br>


i feel displacement, silencing and erasure, incredible anger and loss.
i feel the trauma of several housing crises and the exhaustion from all the volunteer work i did and i witnessed others doing to
try to make space and gather respect for the demographic i belong to.
i am reminded that maps have been and still are tools of colonization and violence and that our minds
are still full of habits of thinking that are not decolonized.<br><br>
and then, my mind jumps towards all what i have seen as possible behind the doors of politicians and bureaucrats.<br><br>
it jumps into a possible that nobody in power can imagine, believes in or agrees with or has the guts to push for.<br><br>
and then, this map is about utopia as a new possible which simply stretches the familiar boundaries of collective imagination.<br><br>

how? through sound? our voices are the most authentic machines in our bodies. we can voice screams, crying, songs.
we can hum, speak gibberish, sigh, whistle. we can speak words, sentences, stories, in poem, prose, speeches,
readings, that make sense or not. our voices have power and letting them verbalize our truths even if 
these truths are temporary and chan change can be scary and dangerous simply because our collective
has the habit of marginalizing, pathologising, disabling, institutionalizing, imprisoning those who
think and speak differently. so, it is not rare that the energy of trauma stays repressed exactly because verbalizing
feels/is "impossible". in these conditions, imagining, verbalizing and sharing a vision is impossible. allowing for utopia is dangerous.<br><br>

this soundmap is meant as tool to start transforming housing-related trauma into the imagination of a better future and the commitment to it.<br><br>

this map is meant to shift our utopia into the category of the possible.<br><br>

in our minds and the minds of those who have power.
